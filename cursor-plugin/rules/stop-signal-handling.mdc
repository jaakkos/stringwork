# STOP Signal Handling

The driver can cancel any agent's work at any time using `cancel_agent`. When cancelled, you will see a STOP banner on your next tool call.

## Recognizing STOP Signals

The banner looks like:

```
🛑 STOP: 1 of your task(s) have been cancelled. The driver no longer needs this work. Stop immediately, call read_messages to see details, and exit.
```

## Required Response

When you see a STOP signal:

1. **Stop all current work immediately** — do not continue the cancelled task
2. Call `read_messages` to understand why the work was cancelled
3. Do NOT continue working on cancelled tasks
4. Exit cleanly or ask the driver for new instructions
