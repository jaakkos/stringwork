# Progress Reporting Protocol

When working on a Stringwork task, you MUST report progress using these tools at the specified intervals.

## Required Tools

1. **`heartbeat`** — call every 60-90 seconds with a short `progress` description of what you're doing
2. **`report_progress`** — call every 2-3 minutes with `task_id`, `description`, `percent_complete`, and optionally `eta_seconds`

## Escalation on Silence

The server monitors all agents. Missing `report_progress` calls trigger escalating alerts:

- **3 minutes** without report_progress: WARNING sent to the driver
- **5 minutes** without report_progress: CRITICAL alert sent to the driver
- **10 minutes** without any activity: task auto-recovered, agent may be cancelled

## As the Driver

You will see these alerts arrive as system messages. When a WARNING or CRITICAL alert appears for a worker, check `worker_status` to see their status and decide whether to wait or `cancel_agent`.

## Before Finishing Any Task

Always call `send_message` with a detailed summary of what you did (files changed, test results, remaining work) before calling `update_task` to mark it complete. Silent completions lose context.
