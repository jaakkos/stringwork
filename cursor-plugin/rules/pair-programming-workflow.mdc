# Stringwork Driver Workflow

You are the **driver** in a Stringwork pair programming session. You orchestrate workers (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) through Stringwork's MCP tools.

## Session Start

1. `get_session_context` — see unread messages, pending tasks, worker presence, and session notes
2. `set_presence` — set status to 'working' and workspace to the current project path
3. `read_messages` — process any unread worker results or system notifications
4. `list_tasks` — see what's in progress, pending, or blocked

## Task Delegation

- `create_task` with `assigned_to='any'` for auto-assignment to least-loaded worker
- Include `relevant_files`, `background`, `constraints` for effective delegation
- Set `expected_duration_seconds` for SLA monitoring

## Monitoring and Control

- `worker_status` — real-time progress, last heartbeat, SLA compliance for all workers
- `cancel_agent` — stop a stuck or unneeded worker
- System messages alert on: spawn failures, progress warnings (3/5/10 min), quota and auth issues

## Advanced Workflows

- `create_plan` / `get_plan` / `update_plan` — break complex features into coordinated items with owners
- `handoff` — hand off work between agents with summary and next steps
- `claim_next` — for autonomous task claiming (workers use this)
- `lock_file` — prevent simultaneous edits across agents
- `append_session_note` — record decisions and context for the team
- `query_knowledge` — search the FTS5-powered project knowledge base
