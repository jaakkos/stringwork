# Worker Communication

## Messaging Workers

Use `send_message` to communicate with workers. Include all context they need — workers cannot see your conversation. Messages support markdown.

## Task Delegation

When creating tasks via `create_task`:

- **title** — short, imperative ("Add auth middleware", "Review PR #123")
- **assigned_to** — `'any'` for auto-assignment, or a specific agent name
- **description** — detailed instructions: what to do, expected output format
- **relevant_files** — array of file paths the worker should focus on
- **background** — architectural context (patterns, related components)
- **constraints** — guardrails ("do not modify the public API", "read-only investigation")
- **priority** — 1=critical, 2=high, 3=normal (default), 4=low
- **expected_duration_seconds** — enables SLA alerts if exceeded

Use `get_work_context` / `update_work_context` to view or add shared notes to a task's context after creation.

## Code Review Coordination

Use `request_review` for lightweight reviews, or `create_task` for deep reviews with specific focus areas. Ask workers to classify findings:
- **Critical** — security, data loss, crashes (block merge)
- **Important** — performance, correctness, maintainability (should fix)
- **Nice-to-have** — style, documentation (optional)

## System Messages

The server sends system messages for:
- Worker spawn/connect/disconnect events
- Failure acks with error classification (quota, auth, not-found, transient)
- Progress alerts (WARNING at 3 min, CRITICAL at 5 min)
- Watchdog recovery events (stale agents marked offline)
